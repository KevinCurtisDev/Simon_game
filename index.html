                <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Aim of the game:</strong> The game will play a sequence of button clicks.
                    Level one is one button click, level two is two button click, and so on.
                    After the game plays a sequence, you must repeate the sequence in the exact
                    same order. This will bring you to the next level, where the sequence will
                    repeate itself and increment itself by one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Game modes:</strong> Clicking the button that says easy will toggle the game mode between 
                    strict/hard mode and non strict/easy mode. Strict mode will reset the game level to zero and deduct a 
                    life each time you get the sequence wrong. Non strict/easy mode will deduct a life each time you 
                    get the sequence wrong, but you will continue on from your current level.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <strong>Lives:</strong> You start the game with three lives. each time
                   you get the sequence wrong you lose a life. When your lives 
                   reach zero the game ends.
                </p>
